# FE-Capstone
Peer-graded Assignment: Booking a table on the Little Lemon website


# Project Title

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for

By working through the lessons in this course, you revisited the necessary concepts and knowledge of front-end development. Using React you put your skills into practice to build a web app for the Little Lemon restaurant.

You completed exercises, received general instructions and code snippets, and utilized links to resources from previous courses to complete this task.

You demonstrated your web development skills by writing code to create a form that handles table bookings for the Little Lemon restaurant.

Now, you will participate in a peer review exercise in which you will submit your completed project for two of your peers to review. 

You will also be required to review a project of two of your peers.

The grading criteria are covered in more detail below.
